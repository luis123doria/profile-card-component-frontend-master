## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I have practiced even more about flexbox and its properties

### Continued development

I must continue to focus on the areas of CSS that are difficult for me such as CSS Grid and Flexbox, as well as some properties to center elements and move them in the way I expect.
In the same way, I should keep reading on the internet about HTML5 and CSS3 to reinforce these topics, and keep practicing
